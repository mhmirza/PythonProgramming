# PythonProgramming

This portfolio captures the work I completed for a course, **Intermediate Programming with Python**, at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2020. To view my GitHub repository, please click [here](https://github.com/mhmirza/PythonProgramming). The work done here involves: gathering data from various sources including web scraping, web API, CSV and other structured data files, and databases; data cleansing; using the Pandas library for data analysis; regular expressions and other string processing methods; classes and object-oriented programming; and building real-world software applications.

# What I hope to learn?

From the course, Intermediate Programming with Python, I wish to learn how to write Python applications for data analysis problems. Moreover, I wish to understand the concepts and use the constructs of Python libraries, including numpy, pandas, and the re (regular expression) package. In addition, I hope to acquire the skills needed to load, cleanse, and process data using Web API's, web scraping and/ or relational databases. Finally, I aim to familiarize myself with writing object-oriented programs.

# Final Project

**Brief Description:** Detecting Network Intrusions - "There is a large and profitable bank in Saint Louis, Missouri. Like any large corporation, this bank has a very large and intricate infrastructure that supports its networking system. A Network Analyst recently discovered unusual network activity. Then, pouring over yearâ€™s worth of logs, their team of analysts discovered many instances of anomalous network activity that resulted in significant sums of money being siphoned from bank accounts.  The Chief Networking Officer has come to your group for help in developing a system that can automatically detect and warn of such known, as well as other unknown, anomalous network activities."

The following tasks were performed as part of this project: _differentiating between the labeled intrusions and benign sessions; identifying different types of intrusions; developing and implementing a systematic approach to detect instances of intrusions in log files; evaluating the detection power of the designed system; assessing the real-time use of the intrusion detector._
