This portfolio captures the work I completed for a course, **Data Mining**, at Carnegie Mellon University in Spring 2021. To view my GitHub repository, please click [here](https://github.com/mhmirza/PythonProgramming). The work done here involves discovering structure and making predictions in large, complex data sets. The tasks encompass learnings about many commonly used methods for predictive and descriptive analytics tasks, in addition to assessing the methods' predictive and practical utility.

# What I hope to learn?

From the course, Data Mining, I wish to learn how to run commonly used data mining methods in R, along with weighing their advantages & disadvantages by comparing their utility through various types of assignments below. In addition, I hope to use real-world datasets to navigate through various stages of model building such as feature selection, model evaluation and resampling to assess the performance & reliability of these methods.

# Final Project

**Brief Description:** Detecting Network Intrusions - "There is a large and profitable bank in Saint Louis, Missouri. Like any large corporation, this bank has a very large and intricate infrastructure that supports its networking system. A Network Analyst recently discovered unusual network activity. Then, pouring over yearâ€™s worth of logs, their team of analysts discovered many instances of anomalous network activity that resulted in significant sums of money being siphoned from bank accounts.  The Chief Networking Officer has come to your group for help in developing a system that can automatically detect and warn of such known, as well as other unknown, anomalous network activities."

The following tasks were performed as part of this project: _differentiating between the labeled intrusions and benign sessions; identifying different types of intrusions; developing and implementing a systematic approach to detect instances of intrusions in log files; evaluating the detection power of the designed system; assessing the real-time use of the intrusion detector._
