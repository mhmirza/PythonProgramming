# PythonProgramming

This portfolio captures the work I completed for a course, **Intermediate Programming with Python**, at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2020. The work done here involves: gathering data from various sources including web scraping, web API, CSV and other structured data files, and databases; data cleansing; using the Pandas library for data analysis; regular expressions and other string processing methods; classes and object-oriented programming; and building real-world software applications.

# Key Learnings

From the course, Intermediate Programming with Python, I learnt how to write Python applications for data analysis problems. I gained an understanding of the concepts and use the constructs of Python libraries, including Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Regex etc. In addition to this, I acquired the skills needed to load, cleanse, and process data using Web API's, web scraping and/ or relational databases. Finally, I was able to familiarize myself with writing object-oriented programs.

# Final Project

**Brief Description:** The Symptom Checker ChatBot - The objective of our project is to create a Python Application that functions like a chatbot and takes user input (based on symptoms) via a series of questions to:

1) Obtain a list of diseases from reliable/vetted online sources (use of maximum three web sources based on reliability) most commonly associated with the symptoms shared by the user.

2) Allow the user to retrieve more information, such as causes, treatment, a list of over-the-counter medications to alleviate the symptoms, and nearby health facilities based on their location.

3) Provide a reference list of a panel of doctors or hospitals based on userâ€™s location for further review by the user.
